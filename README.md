# Activity Recognition for Energy Efficiency in Workplace

## Abstract
 - Detection of human activities is a set of techniques that can be used in wide range of applications, including smart homes and healthcare.
 - In Activity recognition, we need to correctly identify and recognize the individualâ€™s current activities.
 - Designed an IoT device to monitor the activities of the user, without breaching the privacy of the user.
 - Implemented <b>KNN Algorithm</b> to learn the pattern in the sensor data, which has been used to recognize the user activity.
 
## Architecture and IoT setup

 - The IoT device is placed in the Robotics Lab in Dept. of Computer Science at IIT Guwahati.
 - The IoT device is fitted with PIR, PING and LIGHT sensor. All these sensors gave us different sensor values of the student's activities performed in the lab.
